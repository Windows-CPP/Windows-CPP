### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Howdy y'all! My name is Robert Castro, but I also have a few other pseudonyms (Notably, Windows-CPP & StG_44).
I'm a high-schooler, and I develop Python and C++ backend code in my free time.

#### What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm working on LockBox, a set of encryption algorythims for data.
Eventually I want to interpret my own form of packet setup and protocol for it,
so that it can send and receive packets to other LockBox-enabled devices. Will come in
handy for later projects, for sure.

#### What I Will Work On

After LockBox, I have a few projects I need to finish up:

**MASTERMIND -**
A CLI-based version of the popular codebreaking game designed by Mordecai Merowitz, MASTERMIND.
Hopefully, will contain all the notable features of the original game, different difficulties,
and eventually, a game that learns alongside the player.

**CellSimulator -**
A basic program designed to simulate cell behaviour and evolution.
Eventually, I want it to contain advanced evolution algorythims with mutations,
features such as SP02 and light levels, and more.
