### Howdy, y'all! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Robert Castro. and I'm a high-school open-source programmer.

### What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm working on LockBox, which is a set of encryption algorythims for data.
Eventually I want to interpret my own form of packet I/O system for it using a custom protocol,
so tht I have a personal encryption solution for later use in projects. Of course, I also want
to find a way to make LockBox publically available (Free, open-source, and safe) for anyone that wants to either contribute
or use LockBox.

### What I Will Work On

After LockBox, I have a few projects I need to finish up:

**MASTERMIND -**
A CLI-based version of the popular codebreaking game designed by Mordecai Merowitz, MASTERMIND.
Hopefully, will contain all the notable features of the original game, different difficulties,
and eventually, a game that learns alongside the player for a balanced experience.

**CellSimulator -**
A basic program designed to simulate cell behaviour and evolution.
Eventually, I want it to contain advanced evolution algorythims with mutations,
features such as SP02 and light levels, and more. Not for any scientific reason, 
moreso just for a little fun project.
