### Howdy, y'all! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Robert Castro. and I'm a high-school open-source programmer.

### What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm working on LockBox, which is a set of encryption algorythims for data.
Eventually I want to interpret my own form of packet I/O system for it using a custom protocol,
so tht I have a personal encryption solution for later use in projects. Of course, I also want
to find a way to make LockBox publically available (Free, open-source, and safe) for anyone that wants to either contribute
or use LockBox.
